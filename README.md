# Quiz App | Project2_2023

A quiz application is a great way to test knowledge, learn new facts, and have fun with others. It can be use for work team building, family gathering, study or just for fun. It can be modify and enhance this in future. It can be modified and improved as per client's request.

I have developed this quiz app as one of my portfolio projects. It demonstrates some of the skills and knowledge that I acquired from the Advanced Front-end course. This course has been challenging but rewarding, and I am determined to complete it. My goal is to pursue my passion for web development and land my dream job. However, I also have to balance my time between studying, working full-time, and raising three children. I can only devote my mornings, nights and weekends to learning new things. But I believe that with hard work and dedication, nothing is impossible.

This project has been a valuable opportunity for me to reconnect with my roots and express my identity. I have also been able to share my heritage with my children and inspire them to learn more about their Filipino culture and history. I hope they will always remember and appreciate where they come from.

## UX 

To enhance my web development skills, I have been using various resources besides the modules from Percipio, which are provided by Learning People Australia. One of them is the YouTube channel Web Dev Simplified, where I learned some useful concepts and techniques.

### Background and colors:

Chosen background image is related to Quiz and Color choices are simple and easy on eyes. The app creates a positive and engaging experience for anyone who loves quizzes.

### Framework:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Added Bootstrap

### If I would do this project again:
- Add a score at the end of quiz and create a Scoreboard page
- Create a way for player to modify questions by theirselves
- Better positioning of elements
- I will work with a different framework and challenge to learn more
